The metadata I chose to record from this text was chosen mainly based on unique identifiers of each file. This work includes both an instruction book and playing cards for the game, and choosing to focus on the image-based cards rather than the text-based book meant that identifiers to distinguish each card is important. My choices to record what I did were also based on the game that these cards are for. Specifically, I chose to record the card�s author, that author�s works, and the number on the card because this is more base information that helps to distinguish the individual image. Additionally, I recorded whether or not the card had an image of the author on it, also called a �Portrait Card�, whether the number on the card was inside a circle or star, and who the �Connected Author�, or author written in parentheses on the card was. All of these features directly impact the gameplay and the different ways to play this game. With them, you can connect cards to each other to form �Books� and/or �Sequences� in order to win. Any information beyond this, such as expanding the Connected Author on a card into what specific cards would be needed to make a complete �Book� are unnecessary because it would be too much data and would play the game for you.


  Since I chose to focus specifically on playing cards instead of the printed instruction manual, I was unsure of how the OCR/HTR would handle my text, but since the cards are also printed, I chose to find an OCR. I tried Adobe Acrobat first, which did not do well at all and only ever picked up a few correct letters while the rest was gibberish and symbols. Next, I tried Tesseract, installing and running it on a Windows system. Getting the program to run at all was a feat on its own, taking almost three hours before it extracted anything as I figured out the correct commands. I also had to manually set the dpi for the images I was running, which I did at 300. Finally, I could copy and paste the command into Command Prompt, change the input file name to match each playing card, and have Tesseract extract. 
 
  Cleaning the text was tedious, though not quite as labor intensive as extracting, though it did require some decisions. The playing cards themselves do not have a ton of text on them, so even though Tesseract didn�t do too much better of a job than Adobe, manually writing in the entire text was doable, which I did for about a quarter of the images. I found that the cards with author portraits on them were much less accurate, likely because the large image breaks up the text while the other cards have an image at the bottom. Tesseract did the best with the author names at the top of the cards, especially because the font used for the book titles is thicker and harder to read. The numbers at the top of the cards were almost never correct and often represented with a �>� symbol and the images themselves were often interpreted as a string of extra characters. 
  At the end of the book titles, the program almost always put commas, but to me they looked more like periods and so I replaced that punctuation. I also made sure to keep the text top-to-bottom as it is on the card, even though the program put text out of order sometimes. I also had to decide on spacing. The OCR put in its own spaces sometimes, but it was very inconsistent. For the portrait cards, I chose to put space between the numbers, text, portrait, and bottom text, with the numbers on their own separate lines surrounding the author�s name since this is how it would be read. However, for the other cards, I spaced between number and text, but not between author names at the top since they physically only look one line apart. Lastly, I had to choose specific labels. For the image on the non-portrait cards, I simply called it [Image] to keep the illustration open to interpretation, and for portraits, I put [Author name portrait]. I did not see a way to represent the stars or circles on each card in this format.
