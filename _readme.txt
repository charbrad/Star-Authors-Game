The metadata I chose to record from this text was chosen mainly based on unique identifiers of each file. This work includes both an instruction book and playing cards for the game, and choosing to focus on the image-based cards rather than the text-based book meant that identifiers to distinguish each card is important. My choices to record what I did were also based on the game that these cards are for. Specifically, I chose to record the card’s author, that author’s works, and the number on the card because this is more base information that helps to distinguish the individual image. Additionally, I recorded whether or not the card had an image of the author on it, also called a “Portrait Card”, whether the number on the card was inside a circle or star, and who the “Connected Author”, or author written in parentheses on the card was. All of these features directly impact the gameplay and the different ways to play this game. With them, you can connect cards to each other to form “Books” and/or “Sequences” in order to win. Any information beyond this, such as expanding the Connected Author on a card into what specific cards would be needed to make a complete “Book” are unnecessary because it would be too much data and would play the game for you.
